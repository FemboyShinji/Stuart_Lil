    print ('''Hello {}, it is wonderful to meet you! Here is a quick tutorial of how PREC works!
            Just a couple of notes, the program assists you along the way!
            You can use powers, squares and cube numbers [ex. 9**2 = nine to the power of 2/time squared].
            The division sign is the backslash, it is converted to the standard division sign [รท]
            When typing in the file, the file doesn't need to exit. If it already does exit the file will be updated with new equations
            A session of using PREC generates 2 files, a question sheet and an answer sheet [Which is the name of the question sheet with _Answers added to it.]
            Be careful when typing in an answer if you mess up you will have to restart [don't worry its a short process]
            You can press the 'Enter' key instead of 'n' to say no.
            Have fun!
